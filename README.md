# LangModel
Created a language model using LSTM Stack
Dataset was from IBM for the training part

CREATION:-
1) Hyperparameter description
2) Tensorflow.Graph used 
3) Embedding vocabulary and converting to vectors
4) Used 2 layers of LSTM stacked up together
5) Output of 1st layer of LSTM would be one of the input of other layer
6) Optimizer is to be used
7) Class named PTBmodel is the most important part in model as everything is compiled over here
8) At last the training and validation part
9) The lesser the perplexeity, the more confident your model is
10)Perplexeity is randomness count so the above statement is valid.

DEPLOYMENT
It is not done yet but one can deploy using several softwares line DL studio, etc
THANK YOU
Happy Coding!!!
